# Toolbox-JavaScript

**Class:** Toolbox

**Language:** JavaScript

**Platform:** Any

A toolbox for javascript source code snippets that (hopefully) help getting stuff done.

## Setup

To use the toolbox in your project, just copy the relevant javascript files from the `toolbox` folder into it. :)

(However, beware that some files depend on each other - in general, all the files from a subfolder should be present together.)

## Test

To run the self-tests, open locally in your browser the file:

```
test.htm
```

## Versioning

When you check out this repository, all the files should work together with the versions that you are getting.

The reason the version is explicitly included in the filenames, on a per-file basis, is just so that files can be cached forever without a user getting a wrong version.

## License

We at A Softer Space really love the Unlicense, which pretty much allows anyone to do anything with this source code.
For more info, see the file UNLICENSE.

If you desperately need to use this source code under a different license, [contact us](mailto:moya@asofterspace.com) - I am sure we can figure something out.
